<h2>Tool Standards & Poetics</h2>

<div class="container2">

<p>Living in a fast-paced consumerist society that pushes for quick-fixes, and mass production means we, as individuals, rarely get a chance to pause and reflect. “The Programmed Designer” evaluates the ethics behind industry-standard tools, and “The Internet’s Back-to-the-Land Movement” emphasizes on the disconnect resulting from technology; both articles share the commonality of returning home, to our origins, for a greater opportunity of functioning. Although the two authors dissect flaws in the consumerist system, John-Patrick Hartnett acts as a contender whereas Becca Abbe leads towards an observer. John-Patrick Hartnett acknowledges the profound impact standard-design tools have on a designer’s career, as he boldly points out less obvious, long-term problems standard-design tools cause, similar to an imprisonment. To counter being controlled by large software companies, designers must find other avenues to create and not rely solely on the tools. Becca Abbe collects data and evidence ranging from catalogs to movements under a framework to raise awareness. One possible solution is to let go of the status quo, the desire to manage a broken system, and to build an entirely new one. 

The impending resource scarcity discussed in Becca Abbe’s article affects my thought-process internally, and how I intend to show up externally. I believe, being informative of the cause and effects of our actions is the bridge to creating tangible and sustainable results. Becca Abbe’s article has enabled me to explore my understanding around resource scarcity, and the unfiltered truth.</p>

<h2>Code, Letters, Logic, Play</h2>
<p>The development of snow crystals follows nature’s scientific programming; the step-by-step measures create a systematic approach with the given inputs. To start off, the strength of the hydrogen bond keeps the structure intact while the additional water molecules simultaneously join, and the water molecules begin to arrange at -15C (5 F). Due to the construction of rough, angled shapes, water molecules tend to attract to the edges forming a dynamic framework. Then, the water molecules in the crystal lattice are arranged symmetrically into six individual branches; the change in chemical structure is known as crystallization. In this branching process, the atmospheric conditions highly influence the formation of each based on the air moisture diffusion ratio. Sometimes snow crystals skip the liquid stage and kick-starts the formation from the humidity (water vapour). The ever changing conditions in the sky cause the product of snow crystals to be unique and complex, and rarely two are alike. Lastly, snow crystals are sharpened by the narrow terrace and the placement of the crystallization. As the branches reach out, the surface becomes sharper. By the time the snow crystals fall to the ground, most have already completed all three stages. If a snow crystal fails to complete all three stages, it would be uneven, distorted, or rounded, instead of defined.</p>

<h2>Turing Complete User</h2>
<p>Lialina defines universal users as ones “...who have the ability to achieve their goals regardless of the primary purpose of an application or device.” In other words, designing for an universal user means applications are programmed for an audience with specific elements tailored. Lialina’s definition of universal users clicked with me and it was intriguing to hear the different categories of "users".  The foundation of Lialina’s definition can be utilized for Schwulst’s publication of individual websites over platforms to target demographic populations. For instance, knowing that corporations design to maximize profit as their marketing strategy contrasts why individual websites’ value for being better suited for specific population’s needs.

Upon reflection, I think I would fall under the General Purpose User category - I’m not too picky when it comes to my online interactions, I don’t go out of my way to find a special digital space, nor do I mind the standardized UI/UX design. Schwulst’s note on the internet’s function and push for originally states that ”technological advance often coincides with artistic development.” Imagine grocery shopping at your local grocery shop with a list, grabbing a few ready-to-go meals, some staples then leave. That is how I approach the online environment, I visit certain websites for certain purposes and that’s it - I do not go website hunting.</p>

<h2>In Free Fall, Hito Steyerl</h2>
<p>It is no surprise aerial imagery and 3D-generated spaces have a drastic impact on human interaction and perceptions. Steyerl shines light on “hyperreal representations” and caution readers by questioning the effects it has on society. In my interpretation, Steyerl alluded to “for better or worse” in terms of how artificial environments affect one’s psychological, physical, and social health. For example, Virtual Reality can be stimulating and can give an illusion of friendship (chatting with a bot), or exercising (games, running around) which can be seen as positive in hindsight because it boosts confidence. Resorting to Virtual Reality can be an easy way to find relief and enjoyment since it takes minimal effort to achieve the desired stimulus. However, if one relies solely on Virtual Reality to satisfy their need for connection, then they will feel unsatisfied in real life; resulting in a deep void of loneliness. If one is in a prolonged stage of loneliness and dissatisfaction, they can develop mental illness. Finding balance and having the ability to separate real life vs. Virtual Reality can prevent this from happening. All in all, diving into one’s underlying drive for using Virtual Reality can be a good indicator on if it’s “for better or worse.”</p>
